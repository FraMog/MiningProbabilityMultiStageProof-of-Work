# MiningProbabilityMultiStageProof-of-Work

This package provides the functions to compute the mining probability of a miner, in a context which comprises M>=2 miners and k>=1 sequential hash-puzzles. 
It implements the expression 3 obtained in the paper "On multi-stage Proof-of-Work blockchain protocols: issues and challenges" (D'Arco, Ebadi Ansarodi, Mogavero).

## How to use it
1. Download  "MiningProbabilityMultiStageProofOfWork.wl".
2. Put the file in one of the directories listed by the ```$Path``` variable in Mathematica.
3. Import the package in a notebook.
